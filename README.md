# Computer-Science-books
Collection of exercises and notes from various Computer Science books

The purpose of this repo is to track my independent education done in my free time. 
Since I prefer using textbooks instead of online courses, no one will give me a certificate of completion.
This repo is the proof that I'm actually doing my homework.
